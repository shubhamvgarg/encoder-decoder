# encoder-decoder
### I have successfully developed Message encode â€“ decode project in Python. I used the popular tkinter library for rendering graphics on a display window and base64 to encode & decode. 

### In this way, we can encode our message and decode the encoded message in a secure way by using the key.

#### Install tkinter by 
#pip install tkinter
#pip install numpy
